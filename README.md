# Microsoft Agent Module
A Garry's Mod addon that uses [Microsoft Agent](https://agentpedia.tmafe.com/wiki/Microsoft_Agent) to allow use for Microsoft Agent API. The first add-on that uses this module is BonziBUDDY for Garry's Mod.
Note: This requires Windows and 32-bit Garry's Mod.

## Installation
- Download and run the [Microsoft Agent Module Installer](https://github.com/siobhan-saoirse/Microsoft-Agent-Module-Installer/releases/latest) to install the files needed for the addon to interact with Microsoft Agent.
- Make sure you're on the 32-bit version of the game **OR THIS WILL NOT WORK AT ALL.**

You're now all set! If you have the BonziBUDDY add-on installed, he should show up when you load a map! Have fun!
