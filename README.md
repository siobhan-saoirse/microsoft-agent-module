# Microsoft Agent Module
A Garry's Mod addon that uses [Microsoft Agent](https://agentpedia.tmafe.com/wiki/Microsoft_Agent) to allow use for Microsoft Agent API. The first add-on that uses this module is BonziBUDDY for Garry's Mod.
Note: This requires Windows and 32-bit Garry's Mod.

## Installation
- Download and run the [Microsoft Agent Module Installer](https://github.com/siobhan-saoirse/Microsoft-Agent-Module-Installer/releases/latest) to install the files needed for the addon to interact with libsm64.
- Obtain a copy of the US version of the Super Mario 64 ROM (MD5: `20b854b239203baf6c961b850a4a51a2`, SHA1: `9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce`). No, I will not tell you how or where to get this, nor will I send it to you.
- Make sure you're on the 64-bit version of the game **OR THIS WILL NOT WORK AT ALL.** To do this, right click on Garry's Mod in your Steam library and click `Properties...`.  Then click `BETAS` and select `x86-64 - Chromium + 64-bit binaries` from the dropdown.
- Now that Gmod is in 64-bit mode, open it and load a map. Open the spawn menu and under Utilities > G64 > Settings, set the path to the ROM you obtained.

You're now all set! Spawn Mario from the G64 tab and if you did everything right, Mario will spawn. Enjoy!
